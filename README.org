#+title: analytic tableaux 🌸

omg hiiii!! this is my little haskell project for building an analytic tableaux theorem prover!! 💕

basically i'm implementing the tableaux method - it's this super elegant way of checking if logical formulas are satisfiable by building these tree-like proof structures. it's like... formal logic but make it cute??

right now the parser is working and it's SO flexible!! you can write logical formulas with all sorts of symbols:
- negation: ¬, ~, !  
- and: ∧, &, ·
- or: ∨, +, ∥  
- implies: ⇒, →, ⊃
- equivalent: ⇔, ≡, ↔

the whole thing parses your formulas into a nice ast and can pretty-print them back out. next step is implementing the actual tableaux algorithm to build proof trees!! 

it's written in haskell because functional programming makes me happy and parsing combinators are *chef's kiss* ✨

run it with: `cabal run analytic-tableaux "your formula here"`

tests use quickcheck for property-based testing because we love robust code in this house!! 🏳️‍⚧️
